My application development journey has been a very eye opening process so far. As a junior in the North Seattle College AD program, I have learned a lot about the industry and the technologies being used as well as the extreme importance of team work and collaboration in the programming/coding industry.
I am genuinely looking forward to the day when I can look back and feel like I have finally made it, that all the work has paid off, and that I no longer have even a fraction of that imposter feeling that has been prevelant throughout my learning process.
